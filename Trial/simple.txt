# How to Raise PR to Company Git Repo Using Different Git Accounts

## Scenario:
- Personal GitHub account: Has GitHub Copilot Premium subscription
- Company GitHub account: Has access to private company repos but no Copilot Premium
- VS Code: Logged in with personal account for Copilot benefits
- Git operations: Need to use company account for company repo access

## Solution: Dual Account Setup

### 1. Configure Git with Multiple Accounts

#### Option A: Use Git Credential Manager
```bash
# Set up company account for specific repo
git config --local user.name "Your Company Name"
git config --local user.email "your.company.email@company.com"

# For global personal account
git config --global user.name "Your Personal Name" 
git config --global user.email "your.personal.email@gmail.com"
```

#### Option B: Use SSH Keys for Different Accounts
```bash
# Generate SSH key for company account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.company.email@company.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_company

# Generate SSH key for personal account  
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.personal.email@gmail.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# Configure SSH config file (~/.ssh/config)
Host github-company
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_company

Host github-personal
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
```

### 2. VS Code Configuration
- Keep VS Code logged in with personal account for Copilot benefits
- Git operations will use the locally configured account (company account)
- This allows you to:
  - Use GitHub Copilot Premium features
  - Push/pull from company repos with proper authentication

### 3. Workflow for Company PRs

#### Step 1: Clone company repo with company credentials
```bash
git clone https://github.com/company/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

# Set company account for this repo
git config --local user.name "Your Company Name"
git config --local user.email "your.company.email@company.com"
```

#### Step 2: Development workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes using VS Code with Copilot (personal account benefits)
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
4. Push with company credentials: `git push origin feature/your-feature`

#### Step 3: Create Pull Request
1. Go to company GitHub repo in browser
2. Login with company account
3. Create PR from your feature branch
4. Follow company's PR process

### 4. Authentication Methods

#### HTTPS with Credential Manager
```bash
# Windows Credential Manager will prompt for company credentials
git push origin main
```

#### SSH with specific key
```bash
# Using SSH config
git remote set-url origin git@github-company:company/repo-name.git
git push origin main
```

#### Personal Access Token (PAT)
```bash
# Generate PAT from company GitHub account
# Use PAT as password when prompted
git push origin main
```

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure company account has repo access
2. **Wrong Author**: Check local git config for the repo
3. **Authentication Failed**: Verify credentials or SSH keys

#### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check current git config
git config --list --local
git config --list --global

# Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github-company

# Check remote URL
git remote -v
```

### 6. Best Practices

1. **Separate Workspaces**: Consider separate folders for personal vs company projects
2. **Git Hooks**: Use pre-commit hooks to verify correct account usage
3. **Environment Variables**: Set repo-specific environment variables if needed
4. **Credential Isolation**: Use different credential stores for different accounts

### Notes:
- VS Code GitHub integration uses personal account (for Copilot)
- Git CLI operations use locally configured account (company account)
- This setup allows maximum benefit from both accounts
- Always verify git author before pushing to company repos
